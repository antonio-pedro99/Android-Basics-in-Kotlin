# Android Basics in Kotlin

I am revising my knowledge on Native Android Development, in 2017 I started my journey in Android Development with Java, but I had to interrupt my studies for personals reason. Therefore, when I decided to start over, I met Flutter, and I have been using Flutter as my main technology. But now I decided to start over with Native Android Development as it was always a passion. This time, I am learning Android Development with Kotlin instead of Java, and lot of thing has changed and improved.
